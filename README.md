This is a console-based version of an online store, which sells two types of items: video games and movies. 

All store items have an id, title, and price.

Items can be purchased from the store by customers using a gift card associated with their
account. The gift card contains a starting balance of $10 and can be reloaded anytime.

Items can only be purchased if the customer has enough money in their gift card balance. When
the customer makes a purchase:
1. the cost of the item is deducted from their balance and
2. the item is added to the list of items the customer owns.

The customer cannot purchase the same item twice.

The store may also issue refunds to customers who are dissatisfied with their purchase.
Refunds are issued if the customer has consumed less than 30 minutes of the product
(example: playing less than 30 minutes of the video game, or watching less than 30 minutes of
the movie). Otherwise, refunds are not permitted.

If a refund is issued, the original cost of the item is returned to the customer’s gift card balance.
The item is also removed from the customer’s list of owned items.

The store will issue a receipt to the user when an item is either purchased or refunded. Every
receipt displays information about the item, and the amount deducted/refunded.
